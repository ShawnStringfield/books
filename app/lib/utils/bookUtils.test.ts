// I understand that I need to help modify import paths in this test file to reflect the movement of utility files from app/utils to app/lib/utils. However, you haven't provided the actual code section to modify. Without seeing the current contents of app/lib/utils/bookUtils.test.ts, I cannot suggest specific edits.

// Please provide the current code contents, and I will:
// 1. Identify any imports that need to be updated
// 2. Update the paths from 'app/utils/...' to 'app/lib/utils/...'
// 3. Present the changes in a code block with appropriate comments for unchanged sections

// Could you please share the current contents of the file section you'd like me to modify?
